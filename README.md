Hello! My name is Ted Hong, and I'm currently a high school student! I'm a technology enthusiast and I code some projects in my spare time. Notably, I actively develop the Discord bots [Pineapple](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=921991901798871100&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and [Pineapple Testing](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=964240371683053588&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). I also help maintain a collection of public assets for a popular browser game at [Furaken/florr.io](https://github.com/Furaken/florr.io), along with some small other quality of life programs and small apps.
